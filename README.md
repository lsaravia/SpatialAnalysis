Ecological Spatial analysis programns in C++
===============================================================

Several programs for 2D spatial analysis in ecology, including:

1. Spectral Bidimensional analysis that are recodings of fortran routines coded by E. Renshaw. 

2. PairCorrelation analysis

3. Coherence analysis

4. Multifractal extended box estimation

5. Some patch analysis routines

6. Moran's I autocorrelation

7. File conversion routines

8. Ripley's K estimation. Some routines are modified code from: Goreaud F, Pélissier R (1999) On explicit formulas of edge effect correction for Ripley’s K-function. Journal of Vegetation Science 10: 433–438. 

Some of the programs don't even have a makefile.
