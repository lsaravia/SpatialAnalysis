Spatial analysis programns in C++
===============================================================

Several programs for 2D spatial analysis including:

1. Spectral Bidimensional analysis that are ports of fortran routines coded by E. Renshaw. 

2. PairCorrelation analysis

3. Coherence analysis

4. Multifractal extended box estimation

5. Some patch analysis routines

6. Moran's I autocorrelation

7. File conversion routines

8. Ripley's K estimation from: Goreaud F, Pélissier R (1999) On explicit formulas of edge effect correction for Ripley’s K-function. Journal of Vegetation Science 10: 433–438.

Some of the programs don't even have a makefile.
