Ecological Spatial analysis programns in C++
===============================================================

Several programs for 2D spatial analysis in ecology, including:

1. Spectral Bidimensional analysis, some code is ported from fortran routines coded by E. Renshaw. 
    Mugglestone MA, Renshaw E. Detection of geological lineations on aerial photographs using two-dimensional spectral analysis. Comput Geosci. 1998;24: 771–784. doi:10.1016/S0098-3004(98)00065-X

2. PairCorrelation analysis

3. Coherence analysis

4. Multifractal extended box estimation

5. Some patch analysis routines

6. Moran's I autocorrelation

7. File conversion routines

8. Ripley's K estimation. Some routines are modified code from: Goreaud F, Pélissier R (1999) On explicit formulas of edge effect correction for Ripley’s K-function. Journal of Vegetation Science 10: 433–438. 

Some of the programs don't even have a makefile.
